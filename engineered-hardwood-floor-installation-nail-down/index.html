Nailing down hardwood floors is the most common installation method especially for solid flooring. Nail-down installation is a straightforward way of fitting engineered or solid wood flooring but is only advisable if you have a wooden subfloor.

With this method the nails are nearly invisible after installation. The thinner and more flexible the flooring the greater the risk but weve seen issues even on ¾ thick engineered flooring with Baltic birch backing where 12-16 wide spaces between the beads was causing the floor to bounce and squeak.
