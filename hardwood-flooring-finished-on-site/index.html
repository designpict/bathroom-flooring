<p>Pre-finished hardwood flooring is great because half the work of the installation is done before it even leaves the factory. Im not going to tell you how often I do. It is then stained and finished after it has been installed on-site. Whatever your choice Floor Craft Sanding will make the process go smoothly giving you the affordable well-made hardwood floor of your dreams.

<p>Hardwood flooring installation and finishing is just one of our areas of expertise and by the time our flooring clients come to us they usually already know whether they want their floors to be finished in their homes on site or pre-finished from the factory. For those DIY folks out there here is just the cost for the hardwood itself. The wood is more expensive. Its wood flooring that is shipped to the project site without being fully finished so that the purchaser or installer can be the one to sand stain and seal the final product.
