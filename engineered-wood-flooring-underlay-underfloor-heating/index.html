<p>Solid wood flooring isnt stable enough and is more prone to gapping cupping and crowning. The majority of underlay we stock is suitable for underfloor heating however please double check this in the product specifications. It is 2mm thick and has special perforations to aid with the transference of heat this gives it an Ultra Low TOG rating of 023 making it a super choice for underfloor heating installations. Engineered wood flooring has this considerable advantage over solid wood flooring that its stable and can be used when installing a wood floor over underfloor heating.
