<p>Most engineered wood floors can be sanded at least once or twice giving a long life that is enough for most families but for the very best life floors with a top layer of 6mm or more can last for a lifetime in most domestic situations. Also known as real wood top layer flooring engineered wooden flooring has three or four layers a solid oak top layer an HDF or soft wood core and a strengthening bottom. Engineered flooring is usually made up of three or more layers of plywood laid at right angles to each other with a durable top wear layer of natural timber up to 6mm thick. The overall thickness of the floor has little to do with how it will stand up to well wear or how long it will last this is the job of the hardwood top layer.
