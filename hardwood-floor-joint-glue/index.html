<p>When you get into only nailing wide planks that are 4 or wider you can get some movement at the center and back side of the boards which can create a noisy floor and make it harder to sand an unfinished floor. The wall coverings and painting should be completed before the installation of the hardwood flooring. Face nail only the last row if it will be hidden by baseboard or quarter round gluing the last rows together at the tongue and groove will keep them connected enabling them to move with the rest of the floor through seasonal changes. To secure a durable wood floor the boards must be bonded with adhesive in the tongue and groove. How To Install A Laminate Floor Installing Laminate Flooring Diy Flooring Laminate Flooring.</p>

<p>Gluing a floor down with either the glue-assist method or full trowel glue method will not stop a floor from cupping or crowning only well-maintained moisture control above and below will. It is recommended that you use a professional installer if you are gluing to the sub floor. With a glued down or nailed down hardwood floor each plank is fastened directly to the subfloor and not to the adjacent plank so when one plank expands it does not necessarily affect the others planks. Dont use a steel knife as this can leave deep marks and gouges in the wood making your sanding job a lot harder. Stainless Steel Threshold Joint Floor Design Flooring Parquet Design.</p>
