<p>The experts show how to install fold and lock hardwood flooring material. If you can stand it keep the same width as what is existing as a flooring pro can weave in the hallway into the kitchen. Since the flooring is assembled with snap-together tiles or planks you may want to purchase extra pieces that you can insert only if particular areas of your kitchen floor start to wear out over time. My suggestion would be to keep the same species of floor from the hallway into the kitchen.
