<p>This means that oak is heavier and is more wear resistant. When oak flooring planks are assembled randomly the flooring evokes texture and depth. This floor can be graded for more or fewer knots which will help you create a more casual appearance like the Artisans Boutique Showroom in Nantucket or a modern look like the New Hampshire log home.

Pine is an inexpensive lightweight wood that can be yellowish or whitish with brown knots. First oak is hardwood while pine belongs to soft wood varieties. But people usually do not buy heart pine for its durability they buy it for that certian old house look that only heart pine can provide. Oak is much less prone to scratching or denting. A heart-pine floor will resist dents and deep scratches better than a pine floor made from sapwood.</p>
