<p>In my rear living room i have wooden floors as the room has doors to the garden so when the dog comes in from when its been raining it is a lot easier to clean. If youre looking to add a rustic high-end look then hardwood flooring would be better suited. Carpets also have their pros and cons. Preexisting hardwood flooring that is in good to decent condition is the easiest choice. Pin On Floors.</p>
