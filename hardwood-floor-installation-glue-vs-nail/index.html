<p>Glueing nailing and floating are some of the popular methods of flooring installation. I much prefer a real hardwood floor if it is in the budget. Against this floating installation sound a bit more hollow and the floors permit a greater movement due to their installation over a pad. Im not aware of solid hardwood product available as a click flooring. Pin On Home.</p>

<p>Is there such a glue that will allow a solid hardwood floor to be glued directly onto concrete with no future problems. The bamboo is also solid bamboo. A glue down hardwood is the most expensive form of hardwood install we have. The nailed and glued hardwood installations tend to be a bit more solid than the floating type as these are fixed to the ground.
