<p>Most modern hardwood floor planks fit together in a tongue and groove fashion. Hey this is really a good question and I would highly recommend wood flooring for kitchens because the we can clean it up easily by just using a piece of cloth. Solid hardwood floors showcase the natural beauty of wood grain and make any room appear warmer and more elegant. For hardwood floors in the kitchen water is the biggest risk to hardwood planks especially solid wood. Pin On Diy Crafts.</p>
