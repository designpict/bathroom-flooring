<p>The wooden floor which we have been using for underfloor heating for years has a resistance Rc of 0088. Engineered wood engineered wood may not be the best choice since applying too much heat can cause the wood to swell permanently. Solid wood flooring is recommended by us acclimatisation period of at least 1 week 18mm thick.

<p>Bathrooms can get away with just about basic ceramic floor tiles but most of us would recommend any floor to be laid with porcelain more expesive but ultimately so. We recommend KÃ¤hrs Original 15 mm parquet flooring or KÃ¤hrs Linnea 7 mm with Woodloc or Woodloc 5S joints for floors with underfloor heating. This helps the floorboards do not act as an insulator blocking the heat.
