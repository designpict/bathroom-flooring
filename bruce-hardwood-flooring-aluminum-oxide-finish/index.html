<p>These floors have an eased edge and square end treatment and feature the easy care Dura-Luster Semi-Gloss Aluminum Oxide Finish. Silicon carbide and ceramic grain. If the flooring has an aluminum oxide coating it will release aluminum oxide particles and dust when it is being sanded. Earlier versions of the finish saw applications on the top surface but complaints of roughness moved manufacturers to a sandwich type application where the aluminum oxide was applied more to the center layers of the finishing process.

<p>Pre-finished hardwoods are durable for some time. One extra perk is the finish will guard against oxidization and seals the boards top surface. An aluminum oxide finish will really help protect your floor from everyday use over the years. Wood floors finished with UV-cured aluminum oxide generally last 10-15 years longer than post-installation polyurethane finishes.
