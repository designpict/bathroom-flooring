<p>I love Home Depot and Lowes for lots of things but I have seen them drive honest hardworking dealers out of business with their offers that always sound too good to be true. If you believe that big box stores are somehow reputable or looking out for you i have some land to sell you in florida. Lowes has the best flooring and tile selection. Comparing the prices is rather difficult and perhaps pointless because the prices constantly readjust.

<p>In my experience they are significantly more expensive than local installers but you dont have to hunt for competitive bids and if the work is shoddy theyll back it up. If you want 500 pieces of 2x4 its worth the lumber yards time to raise the paperwork while the local Home Depot only has the processing ability to offer you a contractor pack for 10 off or something. Secondly they work with a higher grade of material. Flooring stores use more qualified installers and it can make all the difference. Pin On House.</p>

<p>Lowes offers a wider selection of appliances whereas Home Depot offers a wider selection of flooring. They are going to go the lowest bidder contractor in your area and then put their fee on top of it. Lowes comes in as a close second when it comes to buying your flooring online. Yes while they always require that you pay UPFRONT and IN FULL for the whole carpet job before they will place your carpet order the final bill comes on the day of installation when the independent installer determines that your job requires extra things like - hours of extra floor prep old carpet and padding removal or dump fees new flooring transitions custom upholstery work for stairs.
