<p>Our chart is based on the Janka Hardness Scale which is the industry standard for gauging the ability of various wood species to resist denting and tolerate normal wear. The following comparison chart shows the typical color and graining of some of the most popular exotic hardwood flooring grades that we stock at County Floors. The National Wood Flooring Association NWFA uses a standard lumber grading system that assesses how much variation in natural color and character the unfinished flooring has. Reasons being you will find prefinished manufacturers prefer to stay within a defined area of flooring that is basically more uniform in appearance unless otherwise specified.</p>
<h3 id="below-are-listed-the-relative-hardness-for-numerous-wood-species-used-in-flooring">Below are listed the relative hardness for numerous wood species used in flooring.</h3><p>The method we use for grading our wood flooring is unique to us and more selective than the industry standard. The hardwood grading system was created to help both home-buyers sellers and flooring professionals to have a common point of reference for describing batches of wood with similar qualities. The grade of a wood floor does not refer to the quality of the wood although a higher price tag is often attached to higher grades of wood nor does it concern the durability of the flooring. This is the wood referred to by the NHLA as FAS Firsts and Seconds. Close grain uniform grain pattern similar to hard maples but 25 softer. The wood floors top wear surface.</p>
