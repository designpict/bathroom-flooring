<p>However when using anything wider than 4 consider extra acclimation and use a hardwood floor glue that is recommended by the wood floor manufacturer. It is pretty energy efficient since it offers better heat distribution when comparing to hot air being forced in from the top of the room. Use of radiant heat can exaggerate flooring expansion and contraction cycles when rapid changes in wood moisture content occurs. With the right experience moisture testing understanding of the radiant heat system and knowledge about the wood flooring being used contractors can make wood flooring over radiant heat workeven work extremely well.</p>
